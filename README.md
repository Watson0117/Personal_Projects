<!-- 
    Below is a simple link to a gif image in the same folder as the read me. You may need to add /images to the href link if the image is located in a folder within the same           location as the readme. This will be how I add gifs made from code video to make my portfolio look more professional as well as make it much easier for someone to open my         github and see what I can do without having to download and run my code.
